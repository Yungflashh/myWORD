Welcome to My WORD

    How to Play
   
   1. Start the Game:
      - When you begin, you’ll see a selection of hidden words. The game randomly picks one for you to guess.
   
   2. Input Fields:
      - For each letter in the hidden word, you’ll see an empty box (input field) where you can type your guesses.
   
   3. Making Your Guess:
      - Start typing letters into the input fields, one at a time. You can only enter one letter per box.
      - Once you type a letter, that box will be disabled to prevent changes, so you can focus on the next letter.
   
   4. Getting Feedback:
      - After filling in all the boxes, the game checks your letters:
        - Green Box: The letter is correct and in the right position!
        - Yellow Box: The letter is correct but in the wrong position.
        - White Box: The letter is not in the word at all.
   
   5. Tracking Your Progress:
      - After each guess, your attempt will be displayed above the input fields, showing what you typed and which attempt number it is.
      - You have a total of five attempts to guess the word.
   
   6. Continuing the Game:
      - If your guess is incorrect but you still have attempts left, new input boxes will appear beneath your previous guesses. Keep trying!
   
   7. Winning or Losing:
      - If you guess the word correctly, you’ll see a congratulatory message!
      - If you use all five attempts without guessing correctly, you’ll be notified that the game is over.
   
   Enjoy the Challenge!
   
   The Word Guessing Game is not just about finding the correct letters; it's about strategy and deduction. Have fun guessing, and see how quickly you can figure out the hidden word! Happy playing!`)
